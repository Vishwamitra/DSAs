# Implementation of Datastructure "HEAP" in Python

`minheap` Class is constructed to heapify any passed array as input and return an array in heap data structure in array format.
Heap data structure is of two types - 

### 1. MinHeap
As the name suggests, this is a heap which stores the smallest number as its first "root" number in tree format or in array. Here every child node is bigger than its parent node.
### 2. MaxHeap
Maxheap arranges the numbers in such a way that every parent node is bigger than its child nodes and root number is the biggest of all numbers.
