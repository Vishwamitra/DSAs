If any two of the numbers from the input array sum up to the Target Sum, the function should return those two numbers in an array in any order.
Assumption: There is utmost a single pair of integers whose sum will be equal to the integer provided as an input in the function.
Example:
intArray = [1, 4, 3, 6, 8, 2]
TargetSum = 11
Output = [3, 8] or [8, 3]
